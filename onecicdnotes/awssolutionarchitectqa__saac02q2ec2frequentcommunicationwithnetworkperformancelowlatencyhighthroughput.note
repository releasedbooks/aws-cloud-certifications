Correct Answer: A 
Placement groups -
When you launch a new EC2 instance, the EC2 service attempts to place the instance in such a way 
that all of your instances are spread out across underlying hardware to minimize correlated 
failures. You can use placement groups to influence the placement of a group of interdependent 
instances to meet the needs of your workload. Depending on the type of workload.
A Cluster packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. This strategy enables workloads to achieve the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of HPC applications.
