Correct Answer: C
Scheduled Scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
Scheduled scaling allows you to set your own scaling schedule. 
For example, let's say that every week the traffic to your web application starts to increase 
on Wednesday, remains high on Thursday, and starts to decrease on Friday. 
You can plan your scaling actions based on the predictable traffic patterns of your 
web application. Scaling actions are performed automatically as a function of time and date.
