Which action will meet these requirements?

A. Modify the ALB security group to deny incoming traffic from blocked countries.
B. Modify the security group for EC2 instances to deny incoming traffic from blocked countries.
C. Use Amazon CloudFront to serve the application and deny access to blocked countries.
D. Use ALB listener rules to return access denied responses to incoming traffic from blocked countries.
