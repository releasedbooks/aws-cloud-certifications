AWS Signer is a fully managed code-signing service to ensure the trust and integrity of your code. Organizations validate code against a digital signature to confirm that the code is unaltered and from a trusted publisher. With AWS Signer, your security administrators have a single place to define your signing environment, including what AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role can sign code and in what Regions. AWS Signer manages the code-signing certificate's public and private keys, and enables central management of the code-signing lifecycle. Integration with AWS CloudTrail helps you track who is generating code signatures and to meet your compliance requirements.
