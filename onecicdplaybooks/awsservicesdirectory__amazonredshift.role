Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. Amazon Redshift Serverless lets you access and analyze data without all of the configurations of a provisioned data warehouse. Resources are automatically provisioned and data warehouse capacity is intelligently scaled to deliver fast performance for even the most demanding and unpredictable workloads. You don't incur charges when the data warehouse is idle, so you only pay for what you use. You can load data and start querying right away in the Amazon Redshift query editor v2 or in your favorite business intelligence (BI) tool. Enjoy the best price performance and familiar SQL features in an easy-to-use, zero administration environment.

Regardless of the size of the dataset, Amazon Redshift offers fast query performance using the same SQL-based tools and business intelligence applications that you use today.
