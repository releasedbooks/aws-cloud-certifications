Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly available, and managed Apache Cassandra–compatible database service. With Amazon Keyspaces, you can run your Cassandra workloads on AWS using the same Cassandra application code and developer tools that you use today. You don’t have to provision, patch, or manage servers, and you don’t have to install, maintain, or operate software. Amazon Keyspaces is serverless, so you pay for only the resources you use and the service can automatically scale tables up and down in response to application traffic. You can build applications that serve thousands of requests per second with virtually unlimited throughput and storage. Data is encrypted by default and Amazon Keyspaces enables you to back up your table data continuously using point-in-time recovery. Amazon Keyspaces gives you the performance, elasticity, and enterprise features you need to operate business-critical Cassandra workloads at scale.
