CloudFront is a web service that speeds up the distribution of your static and dynamic web content to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers known as edge locations. When a user requests content that you serve through CloudFront, the request is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency. However, CloudFront does not provide a network connection.
