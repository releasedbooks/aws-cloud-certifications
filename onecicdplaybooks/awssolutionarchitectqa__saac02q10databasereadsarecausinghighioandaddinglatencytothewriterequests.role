An application running on AWS uses an Amazon Aurora Multi-AZ deployment for its database. When evaluating performance metrics, a solutions architect discovered that the database reads are causing high I/O and adding latency to the write requests against the database.

What should the solutions architect do to separate the read requests from the write requests?

A. Enable read-through caching on the Amazon Aurora database.
B. Update the application to read from the Multi-AZ standby instance.
C. Create a read replica and modify the application to use the appropriate endpoint.
D. Create a second Amazon Aurora database and link it to the primary database as a read replica.
