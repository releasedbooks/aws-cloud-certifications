Amazon CodeGuru is a developer tool that provides intelligent recommendations to improve code quality and identify an application’s most expensive lines of code. Integrate CodeGuru into your existing software development workflow to automate code reviews during application development and continuously monitor application's performance in production and provide recommendations and visual clues on how to improve code quality, application performance, and reduce overall cost. CodeGuru has two components:

Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer — Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer is an automated code review service that identifies critical defects and deviation from coding best practices for Java and Python code. It scans the lines of code within a pull request and provides intelligent recommendations based on standards learned from major open-source projects as well as Amazon codebase.

Amazon CodeGuru Profiler — Amazon CodeGuru Profiler analyzes the application runtime profile and provides intelligent recommendations and visualizations that guide developers on how to improve the performance of the most relevant parts of their code.
