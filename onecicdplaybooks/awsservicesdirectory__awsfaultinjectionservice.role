Improve resilience and performance with controlled experiments

Find performance bottlenecks or other unknown weaknesses missed by traditional software tests.

Define specific conditions to stop an experiment or roll back to the pre-experiment state.

Run experiments in minutes using pre-built scenarios from the FIS Scenario Library.

Get superior insights by generating real-world failure conditions, such as impaired performance of different resources.

How it works
Part of AWS Resilience Hub, AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS) is a fully managed service for running fault injection experiments to improve an applicationâ€™s performance, observability, and resilience. FIS simplifies the process of setting up and running controlled fault injection experiments across a range of AWS services, so teams can build confidence in their application behavior.
