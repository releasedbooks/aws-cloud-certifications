Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that continuously scans your AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. Amazon Inspector automatically discovers and scans running Amazon EC2 instances, container images in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR), and AWS Lambda functions for known software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

Amazon Inspector creates a finding when it discovers a software vulnerability or network configuration issue. A finding describes the vulnerability, identifies the affected resource, rates the severity of the vulnerability, and provides remediation guidance. You can analyze findings using the Amazon Inspector console, or view and process your findings through other AWS services
