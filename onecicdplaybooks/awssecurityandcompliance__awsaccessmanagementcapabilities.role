Aws provides a way which decides who can access what type of cloud resources in Aws. 

The service which governs granting desired privileges to the principal is termed as Aws identity access and management. Iam 
In Aws, Iam permits a controlled and a secured access to cloud services and resources that are accessed by users in the organization. IAM service is offered at no additional cost under your Aws account. You will be charged for Aws cloud resources based on access granted to the users. Access keys are required for root or master user or an IAM user to log in to their Aws account. These are long term credentials.

Access keys are used for programmatic requests in case of AWS API or AWS C. There are two parts in an access key, an access key id with a secret access key. You can manage these keys using Aws console, Aws API and AWS cli as per the best security practices. The IAM users key must be regularly rotated. If the permission is given to you by your administrator, you can also rotate your access key. This activity can be performed by AWS management console CLI SDK or API custom password policy can be set to Aws accounts for specifying complex requirement and mandatorily rotating IAM users password. If you do not specify your custom password policy, then an IAM user password must meet the default password policy set by AWS policy for IAM. Password is not applicable to root or master user password or I AM access key. If the password expires, I am user can sign and into the Aws management console but will continue to use their access keys. 

MFA adds an additional security layer for I AM user authentication along with the sign in credentials. Aws provides an extra authentication mechanism. When you sign in to access Aws services or resources. The enablement of MFA can be done through Aws management console, Aws CLI or IAM API. The other way to do this is three U two F security key which can be only done from Aws management console for Aws root users. The enablement can be done only through Aws management console to check the MFA status for root user. You should look in the upper right of navigation bar of your Aws management console to know more about this visit. The link added in the additional reference section 

When you sign up for an Aws account for the first time, you provide details such as email, id, password valid credit card, A valid mobile number and create an Aws account. This account is termed as a master or a root account which has complete access to all cloud services from Aws. The entity can be accessed by using the email id and password that you used at the time of account creation. The IAM user account is a sub account created under Aws master account which has desired privileges granted based on principle of least privilege to perform a desired task or a day job assigned to the user. The IAM user can be a person or an application which uses the credentials to access Aws cloud services or resources. It is strongly recommended that you do not use root user account for your day job. Instead use an I AM user account.
